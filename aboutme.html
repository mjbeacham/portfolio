            <h1>Work History</h1>
            <h3>360 Pro Scooters</h3>
            <p>Store Manager</p>
            <p>I managed a small retail business front-to-back that specialised in sporting goods, including trick scooters, electric commuter scooters, and every imaginable accessory for each.</p>
            <h3>Department of Human Services - Centrelink</h3>
            <p>Technical Support Officer</p>
            <p>Same as a Customer Service Officer, but now I knew so much about everything there is to know about family and parenting related welfare legislation that I also became a point of contact for other staff members who needed technical assistance.</p>
            <p>Customer Service Officer</p>
            <p>I know what you're thinking, "you must have dealt with some real crazy people!". Don't worry I get it all the time. This was actually very rewarding position where I had the chance to assist regular folk with navigating the confusing and complicated world of federal legislation so that people in need could get the assistance they deserved.</p>
            <h3>Toys R Us</h3>
            <p>Retail Monkey</p>
            <p>It wasn't glamorous work, but where else can you set up obstacle courses and race your co-workers around on the electric scooters during the night shift as a teenager and make money?</p>

            <h1>Dig a lil' deeper</h1>
            <p>I'm Matt Beacham, your friendly neighbourhood full-stack web developer!
            <p>But I am also many other things. I have been a musician for most of my life, playing guitar since the age of 12. I have always loved art, both doing and appreciating. If I'm not sketching an idea I just can't get out of my head, I am talking your ear off about how Leonid Afremov is the new Van Gogh of impressionist art. I love books, and I'll consume any sci-fi or fantasy novel you recommend. Please, recommend them to me. I always need more. Finally, I am also a gamer, mostly devouring any story-rich RPG I can get my hands on, but also playing competitively in World of Warcraft, where I recently finished a season of competitive play ranked in the top 0.2% of players worldwide.</p>
            <p>If I'm doing something, I just have to be the best at it.</p>
