## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to present myself as a dev to prospective employers and/or industry professionals, showcasing my skills, interests, personality, and any previous work that I have done.

## Functionality / features

The website contains 4 separate static pages designed to advertise myself to prospective employers and provide methods of contact. It includes:

- A unified nav bar consistent across all pages in order to faciliate ease of use when navigating the website.
- A unified footer providing users with a means of contact via email available regardless of where on the website they are, and a useful navigation link sending the user back to the top of the page.
- A home page which houses an image of myself and a short description of who I am and what I'm about.
- An about me page listing a full history of my education and work experiences, as well as a more robust look at my personality and interests in order for prospective employers to get to know me a bit better.
- A blogs page where I can communicate with users in a longer format should they seek more information about me, also featuring ease-of-use links for navigating to an individual blog post as well as getting back to the top of the page for further navigation.
- A links page where users can find me on other popular and/or relevant places on the internet, as well as a PDF resum√© for more traditional employment interaction.

All pages have unified and simple design elements for a consistent experience across the entire site, also putting content front and centre instead of getting in the way of the primary goal of the site.
